# Comparison-for-models-for-time-series-prediction

This is a small R script which can be used to do a comparative analysis of different time series forecasting methods. I have used this to perform forecasting comparison for air quality data (PM2.5). It can be used for different time series dataset (weather, stocks, real estate prices etc. ) 
It is simple to implement and you just need to use few  R libraries .
